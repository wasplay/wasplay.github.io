Canvas Privacy Policy - 18/06/2021 (Updated on 07/02/2024 for clarity)

LOGS -

Wasplay will temporarily store logs when you contribute to the Canvas :
When adding pixels to the Canvas, your IP address and Oculus ID will be stored on the main server and will be automatically erased after a short amount of time (depending on the activity of the Canvas).
This allows me to ban players with bad intentions quickly. (IP ban + Oculus account ban)

Nothing else is stored or collected and no account creation is required.

In case you get banned, your IP address and Oculus ID will be stored on the main server until you get unbanned.
To get unbanned, or if you want to remove all mentions of your IP address or Oculus ID in the server's logs, please contact me at dev@wasplay.fr
Make sure to mention your Oculus username, and if possible the IP address of the device used to access the app.

DISCORD -

The full Canvas is uploaded every 2 minutes to Discord when there is at least one player connected to the server.
By using the "Crop to Discord" feature, you acknowledge that your Oculus username will be shared on the Wasplay Discord server.
To remove a post uploaded to Discord using this feature, ask any admin on the Wasplay Discord server.
