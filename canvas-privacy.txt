Canvas Privacy Policy - 18/06/2021 (Updated on 30/06/2022)

LOGS -

Wasplay will temporarily store logs when you contribute to the Canvas :
When adding pixels to the Canvas, your IP address and Oculus ID will be stored on the main server and will be erased after a short amount of time (depending on the activity of the Canvas).
This allows me to ban players with bad intentions quickly. (IP ban + Oculus account ban)

Nothing else is stored or collected and no account creation is required.

In case you get banned, your IP address and Oculus ID will be stored on the main server until you get unbanned.
To get unbanned, please contact me on my Discord server or by email at wasplay@sfr.fr.

DISCORD -

The full Canvas is uploaded every 2 minutes to Discord when there is one player or more on the server.
If you use the "Crop to Discord" feature, your Oculus username will also be shared on Discord.

WEBSITE -

The website has been discontinued about a year ago.
