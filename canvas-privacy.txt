Canvas Privacy Policy - 18/06/2021 (Updated on 11/12/2022)

LOGS -

Wasplay will temporarily store logs when you contribute to the Canvas :
When adding pixels to the Canvas, your IP address and Oculus ID will be stored on the main server and will be erased after a short amount of time (depending on the activity of the Canvas).
This allows me to ban players with bad intentions quickly. (IP ban + Oculus account ban)

Nothing else is stored or collected and no account creation is required.

In case you get banned, your IP address and Oculus ID will be stored on the main server until you get unbanned.
To get unbanned, please contact me at dev@wasplay.fr

DISCORD -

The full Canvas is uploaded every 2 minutes to Discord when there is at least one player connected to the server.
By using the "Crop to Discord" feature, you acknowledge that your Oculus username will be shared on Discord.
