	<h1>VRIT Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><em>Last update: 23/02/2021 (edited on 23/07/2025 for clarity)</em>
</p>
	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy describes how Wasplay ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our virtual reality application, VRIT ("the App"). Our fundamental privacy principle is that we do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data. All processing of your information happens exclusively on your local device.
	</p>
	<h2>2. Information We Access and How It Is Used</h2>
	<p>
	To provide the intended in-game experience, the App accesses certain data from your Meta user profile and facilitates the submission of other data to Meta's platform services. 
	</p>
	<h3>Data Handled Locally on Your Device</h3>
	<p>
	The following information is accessed from your Meta profile and used exclusively on your local device. It is never sent to our servers and is discarded when you close the App:
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Your Username and Profile Picture:</b> To display your identity within the App, for example, on your in-game profile or on local user interface elements.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Your Friends List and Followers:</b> To enable local social features, such as viewing friends who also use the App.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Your Age Group:</b> To ensure our content is appropriate for our audience and to comply with platform policies.
	</p>
	<h3>Data Handled by Meta</h3>
	<p>
	<b>Your High Scores and Leaderboard Data:</b> To allow you to participate in competitive leaderboards, your high score is sent to and managed by Meta's platform services. This allows you to compare your performance with other players. The handling of this data is subject to Meta's own Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<h2>3. Data Handling and Storage</h2>
	<p>
	All data handling is performed locally on your device. We want to be perfectly clear:
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>No Server Communication:</b> Your personal data, including your username, profile picture, and friends list, is never sent to, processed by, or stored on any server owned by Wasplay or any third party.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Ephemeral Use:</b> The data accessed from your Meta profile is used "at runtime" only. It is immediately and automatically discarded when you close the App.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>No Third-Party Sharing:</b> We do not, and cannot, share your data with any third-party service because it never leaves your device.
	</p>
	<h2>4. Your Right to Data Deletion</h2>
	<p>
	We do not collect or store any of your personal data on our systems, so there is no data for us to delete. The information used by the App is stored within your own Meta profile.

	However, we are committed to upholding your right to privacy. If you have any questions or wish to receive a formal confirmation that we do not hold any of your data, you have the right to make a data deletion request. Please contact us at <b>dev@wasplay.fr</b>, and we will respond to your inquiry promptly.
	</p>
	<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>
	The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly access any personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently accessed data from a child, we will take steps to ensure that such information is not accessed in future updates.
	</p>
	<h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
	<p>
	If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data handling practices, please contact us at: <b>dev@wasplay.fr</b>.
