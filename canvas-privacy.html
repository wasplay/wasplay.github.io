	<h1>Canvas Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><em>Last update: 18/06/2021 (Updated on 23/07/2025 for clarity)</em>
</p>

	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy describes how Wasplay ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with our virtual reality application, Canvas ("the App"). We are committed to transparency and protecting your privacy while ensuring the security and functionality of the App.
	</p>
	<h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
	<p>
		To provide the full experience of the App, we need to collect or access certain information. We have broken this down by purpose below.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Information from Your Meta Profile:</b> We access your basic Meta profile information to identify you in the App. This includes <b>your Oculus ID and Username</b> to attribute your contributions (pixels) on the Canvas, display your name on leaderboards, and for security purposes as detailed below.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Information for App Security and Moderation:</b> When you contribute to the Canvas by adding a pixel, we automatically log information on our main server for security and moderation purposes. This is essential to prevent abuse and ban users with malicious intent. This information includes <b>your Oculus ID and your IP Address</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Information for Leaderboards:</b> To allow you to participate in leaderboards, your high score and Oculus Username are sent to and managed by Meta's platform services. The handling of this data is subject to Meta's own Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>User-Generated Content:</b> The "Crop to Discord" feature allows you to share a portion of the Canvas. Using this feature is an explicit action that shares content publicly, as detailed in the next section.
	</p>
	<h2>3. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
	<p>
		We do not sell your data. However, certain features of the App involve sharing information with third-party platforms to function.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Meta:</b> As stated above, your leaderboard data is sent directly to Meta's services.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Discord:</b> We use Discord to share community content.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Automated Canvas Updates:</b> An image of the full Canvas is automatically uploaded to the official Wasplay Discord server approximately every two minutes while the App is in use by at least one player. This image does not contain any direct personal information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>"Crop to Discord" Feature:</b> When you use this feature, you acknowledge and agree that a cropped image of the Canvas and <b>your Oculus Username</b> will be publicly posted on the Wasplay Discord server, crediting you for the post.
	</p>
	<h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
	<p>We take reasonable measures to secure the data we handle.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Temporary Security Logs:</b> Security logs containing your Oculus ID and IP address are stored on our server and are automatically erased on a rolling basis, typically after 72 hours, unless a security incident requires a longer retention period for investigation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Information for Banned Users:</b> If you are banned from the App for violating our terms, your Oculus ID and IP address will be retained on our server for as long as the ban is in effect to prevent you from re-entering the service.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Data Shared to Discord:</b> Content posted to Discord remains there according to Discord's own policies.
	</p>
	<h2>5. Your Rights and How to Manage Your Data</h2>
	<p>You have rights over your data. We provide a single point of contact to make exercising these rights as simple as possible.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Primary Contact:</b> To make any request regarding your data, please email us at <b>dev@wasplay.fr</b>.
	</p>
	<h3>Requesting Data Deletion</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Server Logs:</b> You can request the deletion of your Oculus ID and IP address from our temporary server logs by contacting us.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Unbanning:</b> If you are banned, you can contact us to appeal the decision. If the ban is lifted, your information will be removed from our ban list.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Leaderboard Data:</b> To manage your leaderboard scores, you must use the privacy tools and settings provided by Meta.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Discord Posts:</b> To request the removal of a post you made using the "Crop to Discord" feature, you can either ask an administrator on our Discord server directly or email us at our contact address for assistance.
	</p>
	<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>
		The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently done so, we will take commercially reasonable steps to delete that information.
	</p>
	<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
	<p>
		If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <b>dev@wasplay.fr</b>.
